# Data Structures
This project explores some common Data Structures and their implemtations in Python. These Data Structures can be enhanced and further optimized, but the purpose of this project is for exploratory purposes to get a deeper understanding of how some of these Data Structures work behind the scenes.

## Getting Started

Download the repository and get started. This project does not depend on any external libraries. 

### Prerequisites

Python 3.x and any text editor.

```
1.Open /src
2.Open a .py file for the Data Structure you want to explore
3.Un-comment the code at the bottom of the file to see an example
4.Run to see an example of the Data Structure being implemented
```
